# RiemannR

### EEG-based BCI analysis with Riemannian geometry.

This R package contains useful functions for the analysi of data from eeg-based brai-computer interfaces.
In particular, it has been developed for the analysis of "Brain Invaders" data, which can be find here: https://zenodo.org/record/1494240#.XWjtji9aaRv.

There are also simple Python scripts for working with the dataset at https://github.com/plcrodrigues/BrainInvaders-2013a-Dataset.

This is the first version of the package and it is under development.
